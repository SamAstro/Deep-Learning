# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation Program

## Synopsis

This is the repository of all the projects I will carry out during [Udacity Deep
Learning Nanodegree Foundation
Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)

## Table of contents
### Project 1 -- your first neural network
Using only numpy, we build a neural network from scratch to carry out
predictions on daily bike rental ridership.

### Project 2 -- images classification
Using tensorflow, we build a convolutional neural network to classify images
from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and
other objects.

My network is as follows:
* 3 convolutionnal and max pool layers
* 1 flatten layer
* 3 fully connected layers with 0.5 dropout
* 1 output layer

Epoch: 20
Batch size = 128

## Prerequisites
You need:

* Jupyter  
* Python 3.x  
* The following Python library:  
    * Numpy
    * Matplotlib
    * Tensorflow and all its dependencies

## Running

To run the notebook, you need Jupyter installed with a Python 3.x kernel. Then
just run 
```
> jupyter-notebook-3.x notebook_name.ipynb
```
in the corresponding directory.
